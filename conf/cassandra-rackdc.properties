# These properties are used with GossipingPropertyFileSnitch and will
# indicate the rack and dc for this node

# Add a suffix to a datacenter name. Used by all cloud-based snitches.

# Uncomment the following line to make this snitch prefer the internal ip when possible, as the Ec2MultiRegionSnitch does.
# prefer_local=true

# Datacenter and rack naming convention used by the Ec2Snitch and Ec2MultiRegionSnitch.
# Options are:
#   legacy : datacenter name is the part of the availability zone name preceding the last "-"
#       when the zone ends in -1 and includes the number if not -1. Rack is the portion of
#       the availability zone name following  the last "-".
#       Examples: us-west-1a => dc: us-west, rack: 1a; us-west-2b => dc: us-west-2, rack: 2b; 
#       YOU MUST USE THIS VALUE IF YOU ARE UPGRADING A PRE-4.0 CLUSTER
#   standard : Default value. datacenter name is the standard AWS region name, including the number.
#       rack name is the region plus the availability zone letter.
#       Examples: us-west-1a => dc: us-west-1, rack: us-west-1a; us-west-2b => dc: us-west-2, rack: us-west-2b;
# ec2_naming_scheme=standard
#
# Type of AWS IMDS, value might be either "v1" or "v2". Defaults to "v2".
# ec2_metadata_type=v2
# If AWS IMDS of v2 is configured, ec2_metadata_token_ttl_seconds says how many seconds a token will be valid until
# it is refreshed. Defaults to 21600. Can not be smaller than 30 and bigger than 21600. Has to be an integer.
# ec2_metadata_token_ttl_seconds=21600

# If you are using GenericCloudMetadataServiceSnitch, this property controls what URL
# that snitch will execute GET request against, expecting 200 HTTP response code,
# not sending any headers to such service. The response is parsed in such a way that if it contains this string:
# "us-central1-a", it will resolve 'us-central1' as the datacenter and 'a' as the rack - string after the last
# dash is rack, everything before the last dash is datacenter.
# metadata_url=http://some/metadata/serice/url

# For all cloud-based snitches, there are following options available:
#
# Sets a specified timeout value, in duration format, to be used when opening a communications link to metadata service,
# referenced by an URLConnection. The timeout of zero (0s) is interpreted as an infinite timeout.
# Defaults to 30 seconds.
# metadata_request_timeout=30s
